# 10X CRM

A lightweight Customer Relationship Management app for sales managers, built with vanilla JavaScript and SCSS — no frameworks, no libraries. It lets a user register, log in, and manage a pipeline of clients: add them, search and filter them, move them through deal stages, log notes, and set follow-up reminders. All data persists in the browser's `localStorage`, and the initial client list is seeded from the DummyJSON REST API.

## Live Demo

**https://10x-crm-ashy.vercel.app**

Deployed on Vercel. The site root redirects to the login page.

## Features

**Authentication**
- Sign up with six validation rules (name length, email format, duplicate email, password strength, password confirmation)
- Log in with a deliberately vague `Invalid email or password` error, so the app never reveals which registered emails exist
- Auth guard on every page: protected pages redirect logged-out visitors to the login page, and the login/signup pages redirect logged-in users to the dashboard
- Logout clears only the session — registered users and client data survive

**Dashboard**
- Personalised greeting using the session user's first name
- Live clock updating every second via `setInterval`
- Four computed statistics: Total Clients, Active Deals, Won Revenue (formatted with thousands separators), and New This Week
- Pipeline overview counting clients per status
- Recent Clients table showing the five most recently added

**Clients**
- Loads 30 clients from the DummyJSON API on first visit, then caches them in `localStorage`
- Add a client through a validated modal form (`POST` to the API)
- Delete a client with a confirmation dialog (`DELETE` to the API)
- Change a client's deal status directly on the card
- Combinable search, five status filter chips, and five sort options — none of which mutate the source array
- Client details modal with a timestamped, persisted notes log
- "Remind me in 1 minute" follow-up toast that still fires after the modal is closed
- Loading indicator while fetching, plus an error state with a Retry button

**Profile**
- Identity panel with avatar initials, name, email, company, and member-since date
- Edit profile name and company
- Change password — the old password stops working immediately, the new one works
- Reset Data wipes only the client list and re-seeds it from the API, leaving accounts and the session untouched

**Global**
- Dark/light theme toggle, persisted across pages and reloads
- Toast notifications that auto-hide after 3 seconds
- Inline field-level error messages under each invalid input
- Email and password fields accept Latin characters only — a Georgian character typed or pasted by accident is stripped as you type, so it can never silently lock you out of your own account. Name and company fields stay unrestricted and accept Georgian freely.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Markup | HTML5 (5 separate pages) |
| Styling | SCSS compiled to CSS, mobile-first, BEM naming |
| Logic | Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) — no frameworks or libraries |
| Persistence | Browser `localStorage` |
| API | [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com) (`GET` / `POST` / `DELETE` on `/users`) |
| Async | `fetch` with `async`/`await`, `try`/`catch`, and `response.ok` checks |
| Build | [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) (the only dev dependency) |
| Hosting | Vercel |

### Project structure

```
html/    index.html  signup.html  dashboard.html  clients.html  profile.html
css/     main.css                 ← compiled from scss/, never hand-edited
scss/    abstracts/ base/ components/ layout/ pages/ themes/ main.scss
js/      storage.js  guard.js  data.js  auth.js  dashboard.js  clients.js  profile.js
```

Shared logic lives in one place rather than being copied across pages:

- **`storage.js`** — the only file that touches `localStorage` directly; everything else goes through its helpers and the `STORAGE_KEYS` constant.
- **`guard.js`** — loaded on all five pages: the auth guard, theme handling, logout, toasts, field-error helpers, and validation helpers.
- **`data.js`** — the single place that knows how to load, cache, and mutate the client list; shared by both the dashboard and the clients page.

### localStorage keys

| Key | Contents |
|---|---|
| `crm_users` | Array of registered user objects |
| `crm_session` | The current session, or absent when logged out |
| `crm_clients` | Array of client objects — the app's main state |
| `crm_theme` | `"light"` or `"dark"` |

## How to Run

The app is plain static files, so no build step is needed to run it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DonKravche/10x-CRM.git
cd 10x-CRM
```

Then open `html/index.html` in your browser.

Using a local web server is recommended (for example the **Live Server** extension in VS Code), since the client list is fetched over the network from DummyJSON.

To recompile the stylesheet after editing anything in `scss/`:

```bash
npm install
npm run build:css     # one-off compile
npm run watch:css     # recompile on save
```

## Test Account

There is no pre-seeded account. Because every user is stored in the browser's own `localStorage`, accounts do not travel with the deployed site — each browser starts empty.

Please register a new account on the Sign Up page. Any values satisfying the validation rules will work, for example:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Full Name | `Demo User` |
| Email | `demo@test.com` |
| Password | `demo1234` |

After registering you are redirected to the login page — sign in with the same credentials, and the 30 seed clients load automatically on the Clients page.

## Security Note

Passwords are stored in plain text in `localStorage`. This is acceptable **only** because this is a backend-less learning project. A real product must hash passwords server-side and never store them anywhere the browser can read.

- Built by **Dongi** as the individual project for the JavaScript module exam.
- Client seed data from the free [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com) test API.
- Reference documentation: [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) and the [DummyJSON docs](https://dummyjson.com/docs/users).
- AI assistance (Claude) was used throughout; every prompt, what was kept, what was rewritten, and what was rejected is documented in [`ai-log.md`](ai-log.md).
