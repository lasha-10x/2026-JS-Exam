# 10X CRM

A lightweight customer relationship management app for sales managers. Track clients through a simple pipeline (Lead → Contacted → Won / Lost), leave notes, set follow-up reminders, and review daily stats on a dashboard.

## Features

- Sign up and login with session-based auth (localStorage)
- Auth guard for protected pages + logout
- Dark / light theme preference
- Clients list loaded from DummyJSON API and persisted locally
- Add / delete clients via API (POST / DELETE) with local persistence
- Search, status filter chips, and sorting
- Client detail modal with notes and 1-minute reminders
- Dashboard: live clock, stats, pipeline overview, recent clients
- Profile edit, password change, and CRM data reset

## Tech Stack

- HTML5, CSS3 (custom properties for theming)
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com) for sample user data
- Browser `localStorage` for users, session, clients, and theme
- Deployed on Vercel
